# Syntax

JavaScript's syntax is very consistent. Every new code block is indicated by curly braces (`{}`). Almost any line can and should be ended with a semicolon (but JavaScript isn't pernickety about it like some other languages *cough cough Java* however it is good practice to get into the habit of using them)
