# Understanding the commands

Node has a few different commands that are very useful. They are `node` and `npm`.

The reason I am explaining this now is so you can test code while you read it.

## The `node` command

This command is used to run a javascript file. Simply just do `node path/to/file` to run a specific file or `node .` to run a package (more on this later).

## The `npm` command

NPM stands for Node Package Manager and is how you install dependencies into your project.
There are a few commands. These include:
- `npm install <name>` - installs a dependency to your project or if you add `-g` or `--global` at the end, it will install it as a global package so you can run commands it provides.
- `npm init` - initializes your current directory to be able to make a project and for usage with npm.

Later in the series I will explain these in more detail and more commands.
